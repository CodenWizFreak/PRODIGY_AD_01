# PRODIGY_AD_01

Welcome to **PRODIGY_AD_01**, a simple yet effective calculator application! This app provides essential arithmetic functionalities and includes a convenient day/night mode toggle to enhance user experience across different lighting conditions. This is a project I created while interning at Prodigy Infotech for Android Development.

## Features


- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Day/Night Mode Toggle**: Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing in various environments.

## Screenshots

Below are some snapshots of the app showcasing the day and night modes:
